# Professional Certificate - 9-Course Series

I completed this program, developed by software engineering experts at Meta (the creators of Facebook and Instagram), which prepares professionals for a career as a back-end developer. Throughout its nine courses, the following topics were covered:

- **Fundamentals of Python** â€” from syntax to solving practical coding challenges.  
- **Key programming systems** such as Linux commands, Git, SQL, version control, APIs, JSON, XML, and more.  
- **Building a portfolio** and interview preparation tips, focusing on what to expect when interviewing for engineering roles.  
- **In-demand programming skills** and how to confidently use code to solve real-world problems.

### Hands-On Learning

During each course, I completed micro-projects to reinforce the learning experience, culminating in a **Capstone Project** where I applied all acquired knowledge to build a complete Django application. Among the practical activities were:

- Efficiently solving problems in Python.  
- Managing projects on GitHub using Git and the Linux terminal.  
- Creating and deploying applications with Django.  

By the end of the program, I integrated all these concepts into a final project that consolidated my back-end development skills, covering everything from code versioning and database management to REST API creation and cloud deployment.

I expanded the original project by deploying it to the AWS cloud using services such as Lambda, RDS, S3, and CloudFront. The full solution can be found in this repository: [AWS Capstone Project](https://github.com/Val-Cantarelli/Meta-AWS-Capstone).
